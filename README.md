# Pig Game

Welcome to the Pig Game! This is a simple and fun dice game for two players. The goal is to be the first player to reach the winning score by rolling the dice and holding your points strategically. However, be careful, as rolling a 1 will reset your turn score to 0!

## How to Play

1. **Start the Game**: The game begins with Player 1.
2. **Rolling the Dice**: On your turn, you can roll a single six-sided die as many times as you like.
3. **Accumulate Points**: Each roll adds the rolled number to your turn score.
4. **Rolling a 1**: If you roll a 1, your turn score resets to 0, and it becomes the next player's turn.
5. **Holding**: At any point during your turn, you can choose to hold. Holding adds your turn score to your total score, and it becomes the next player's turn.
6. **Winning**: The first player to reach the winning score (usually 100 points) wins the game.

## Rules

1. The game is played by two players taking turns.
2. On each turn, a player rolls a six-sided die.
3. If the player rolls a 1, their turn ends, and their turn score resets to 0.
4. If the player rolls any other number, it is added to their turn score.
5. The player can choose to roll again or hold.
6. If the player holds, their turn score is added to their total score.
7. The first player to reach the winning score (default is 100 points) wins the game.
